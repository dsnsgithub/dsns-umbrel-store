description: >-
  YT-DLP Stream is a minimal self-hosted web interface that uses yt-dlp to stream video or audio directly to your browser without saving anything to disk.
  
  Enter a URL, choose video or audio, and it streams the content as a direct download. Supports YouTube and hundreds of other sites. No persistent storage is used—perfect for low-disk setups or quick one-off downloads.
  
  Built with Flask for simplicity; processes on the fly using yt-dlp's stdout streaming.

  Initial release with streaming support.
